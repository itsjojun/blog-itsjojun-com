# How Computers Handle Data in Binary

Computers handle data using **binary**, which means everything is stored as **0s and 1s**.

Computers don’t understand words, pictures, or numbers the way humans do. At the most basic level, they are made of tiny switches called **transistors**. A switch can be **ON** or **OFF**, just as any switch (e. g. a light switch) can. A turned off switch or transistor is described as to be at state `0` and a turned on switch or transistor at state `1`. You may also know this way of describing on or off states from your home devices like switches on vacum cleaners and so on.

Because computers can only handle `on` or `off` states or, correctly saying, `0` and `1`, every piece of data like numbers, letters, images, movies, music is converted into a **long sequence of 0s and 1s** and handled as it by the computer.

- Using only two states makes computers **fast, reliable, and simple**.

now to make use of this system, gremiums defined encoding for these sequences of `0`s and `1`s. For example:

- Example: The letter `'A'` → `01000001` (ASCII encoding)
- Example: The number `5` → `00000101` (binary)
  
## How Computers Use Binary

- The CPU reads these 0s and 1s and performs operations using **logic circuits**.
- These circuits can **add numbers, compare values, or check true/false conditions**.

## Summary

Binary is the **language of computers**. Everything gets translated into 0s and 1s so the machine can **store, process, and understand** data efficiently.
