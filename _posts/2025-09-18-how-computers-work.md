## How Computers do anything

Computers don’t understand words, pictures, or numbers the way humans do. In fact they actually do not really 'understand' or work with more than two things which, at the most basic level are two kind of states, POWER OFF and POWER ON. Or something or nothing, yes or no, or positive or negative, or just simply put in numbers, 0 and 1.

At the most basic level computers are all made up of tiny switches called **transistors**. Each an every one of these switches can be **ON** or **OFF**, just as any switch (e. g. a light switch) can. A turned off switch or transistor (thats what they are correctly called) is described as to be at state `0` and a turned on switch or transistor at state `1`. You may also know this way of describing on or off states from your home devices like switches on vacum cleaners and so on.

Because computers can only handle and save `on` or `off` states or, correctly saying, `0` and `1`, every piece of "data" we as humans know as such (like digital emails, images, movies, music, etc.) is converted into a **long sequence of 0s and 1s** and handled as it by the computer.

This system of 0s and 1s is called the binary system, as there only do exist *two* states. The word binary comes from the Latin word bini, meaning two together or pair.

Now knowing that, implies that for saving large amounts of data (), computers must have many of these switches. And they do,  

Fascinating, isn't it? But its not the end.

In order to be able to handle and store a image or video, a computer needs

where does computer word come from?

- Using only two states makes computers **fast, reliable, and simple**.

now to make use of this system, gremiums defined encoding for these sequences of `0`s and `1`s. For example:

- Example: The letter `'A'` → `01000001` (ASCII encoding)
- Example: The number `5` → `00000101` (binary)
  
## How Computers Use Binary

- The CPU reads these 0s and 1s and performs operations using **logic circuits**.
- These circuits can **add numbers, compare values, or check true/false conditions**.

## Summary

Binary is the **language of computers**. Everything gets translated into 0s and 1s so the machine can **store, process, and understand** data efficiently.
